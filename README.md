This is the final project for [The Odin Project's](https://theodinproject.com) course on Rails! It is supposed to be a Facebook like web application, with user authentication, fun associations, nested routes, etc. I will be trying to implement AWS asset storage for users, as well as user registration with the Devise gem and common social media apis. A mailer will be set up with the Sendgrid addon for Heroku upon deployment to production. 

```bash
  yarn add bootstrap jquery popper.js
```
